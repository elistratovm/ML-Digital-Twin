# ML-Digital-Twin

## Skoltech Machine Learning 2025 Final Project

### Project Description
This project is dedicated to creating a digital twin for relay protection using machine learning methods. Within the scope of the Machine Learning course, a model was developed to predict and monitor the state of relays, using various data processing techniques, such as binary classifiers, as well as more complex approaches based on recurrent neural networks (RNN/LSTM).

### Project Structure
The project consists of three main folders:

1. dataset
This folder contains the entire dataset used for training and testing the models. Here, you will find all the data that was collected and prepared for analysis and training.

2. Binary
The Binary folder includes all materials related to binary classifiers developed and applied within the project. It contains code, models, and other files related to binary classification methods for the relay protection task.

3. Multi
The Multi folder contains all the work related to the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and LSTM for more complex predictions and analyses. Here you will find all the materials and experiments related to multi-step forecasts, time series, and other approaches using RNN and LSTM.
